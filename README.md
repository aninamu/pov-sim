# About

Included in this repo are uninstrumented sample applications that serve as starting points for you to add instrumentation as specified in the instructions of select tasks.

The following applications, which are configured to run in Docker containers, expose identical API interfaces but are implemented in different languages:
- `flight-app-js` - Express.js backend application
- `flight-app-py` - Python Flask backend application

# Getting Up and Running

## Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your local machine
- Clone this repo to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/aninamu/pov-sim.git
```

## flight-app-js
From the `flight-app-js` directory:

Build the app
```
make build
```
Run the app
```
make run
```
Alternatively, use a single command to both build and run the app:
```
make start
```

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:3000/

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ to view the API interface and make requests

## flight-app-py
From the `flight-app-py` directory:

Build the app
```
make build
```
Run the app
```
make run
```
Alternatively, use a single command to both build and run the app:
```
make start
```

The app should now be up and running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/apidocs/ to view the API interface and make requests

# Cleanup
The Makefiles included with each application include additional commands to stop running containers and to clean up stopped containers.

To stop a container, run the following command from the app root:
```
make stop
```

To remove a container, run the following command from the app root:
```
make clean
```

# Batch Requests

This repo includes a shell script in `batch_requests.sh` that allows you to make batch requests to an endpoint to generate higher volumes of traffic.

Note: You may need to run the following command to make the script executable:
```
chmod +x batch_requests.sh
```

## Usage
Running the script entails executing a shell command of this format from the base root of the repo:
```
./batch_requests.sh <endpoint> <num_requests>
```

### Example - Ping GET airlines endpoint 100 times
```
./batch_requests.sh http://localhost:3000/airlines 100
```

### Example - Trigger error on GET airlines endpoint 100 times
```
./batch_requests.sh http://localhost:3000/airlines/raise 100
```

### Example - Ping GET flights endpoint 100 times:
```
./batch_requests.sh http://localhost:3000/flights/AA 100
```

### Example - Trigger error on GET flights endpoint 100 times
```
./batch_requests.sh http://localhost:3000/flights/AA/raise 100
```

_Note: These sample commands assume the application you wish to ping is running locally at http://localhost:3000. Replace with the proper value as needed._
