# ðŸš€ PoV Flight Simulator ðŸš€

Welcome to the PoV Flight Simulator.

This repo holds the starting points for you to complete the assigned tasks.

# About

Included in this repo are uninstrumented sample applications that serve as starting points for you to add instrumentation as specified in the instructions of select tasks.

- `flights` - Python Flask backend application

# Getting Up and Running

## Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your local machine
- Clone this repo to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/aninamu/pov-sim.git
```

## Running flights

From the `flights` directory:

Build the app
```
make build
```

Run the app
```
make run
```

Alternatively, use a single command to both build and run the app:
```
make start
```

The app should now be up and running at http://127.0.0.1:5001/

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5001/apidocs/ to view the API interface and make requests

## Cleanup

The Makefiles included with each application include additional commands to stop running containers and to clean up stopped containers.

To stop a container, run the following command from the app root:
```
make stop
```

To remove a container, run the following command from the app root:
```
make clean
```

## Running all apps at once

From the project root:

Run all the services
```
make up
```

- The `flights` app will run on http://127.0.0.1:5001/ with Swagger docs at http://127.0.0.1:5001/apidocs/


Stop the running apps
```
make down
```

# Batch Requests

This repo includes a shell script in `batch_requests.sh` that allows you to make batch requests to an endpoint to generate higher volumes of traffic.

Note: You may need to run the following command to make the script executable:
```
chmod +x batch_requests.sh
```

## Usage
Running the script entails executing a shell command of this format from the base root of the repo:
```
./batch_requests.sh <endpoint> <num_requests>
```

### Example - Ping GET airlines endpoint 100 times
```
./batch_requests.sh http://localhost:3000/airlines 100
```

### Example - Trigger error on GET airlines endpoint 100 times
```
./batch_requests.sh http://localhost:3000/airlines/raise 100
```

### Example - Ping GET flights endpoint 100 times:
```
./batch_requests.sh http://localhost:3000/flights/AA 100
```

### Example - Trigger error on GET flights endpoint 100 times
```
./batch_requests.sh http://localhost:3000/flights/AA/raise 100
```

_Note: These sample commands assume the application you wish to ping is running locally at http://localhost:3000. Replace with the proper value as needed._


# Deploying a Helm chart

You may wish to deploy a Helm chart to complete one of the tasks. This repo contains an example Helm chart that can be used for a sample Kubernetes deployment.

Included is a recommended approach for using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) to deploy a local Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Install minikube https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
- Install helm https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

## Getting up and running

Start your cluster
```
minikube start
```

Option to view the local Kubernetes dashboard
```
minikube dashboard
```

Install the sample Helm chart
```
helm install sample-chart helm-charts/sample-chart
```

Confirm the pod is up and running
```
kubectl get pods
```
